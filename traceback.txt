I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 72, in script
    n dog hungry "That’s definitely your stomach. You successfully get onto all four legs to try and look around for food scraps or a trash can."
Exception: Say has image attributes ('dog', 'hungry'), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
